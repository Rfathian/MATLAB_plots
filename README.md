# Matlab_plots
MATLAB plots is a repository that contains sample codes and data to generate standard format (size, ratio, format, fonts, etc) of plots that could be used for the research article, project reports, conference paper, and journal papers.

Codes are going to be uploaded gradually, if you need anything urgent let me know so i can help you out.
